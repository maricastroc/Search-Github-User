<h2>:computer: What I Learned</h2>
<p>Instead of searching for a user just by username (according to the challenge), I added a new feature to search for a user by name, displaying all cards corresponding to the search value. The cards are clickable and lead to a new route, where only the selected user's information is listed.</p>
<p>This was an excellent exercise to practice using routes in React, as well as passing parameters between different routes in the application. I also tried to use componentization as much as possible and used TypeScript to better organize the project and prevent bugs.</p>
