## üìö Project Description

This is an application that enables you to list GitHub users based on their name. The results are displayed through clickable cards, which can redirect users to either the user's GitHub page or a new application route that provides more detailed information about the selected user.

## üìå What did I learn?

This was an excellent exercise to practice using routes in React, as well as passing parameters between different routes in the application. I also tried to use componentization as much as possible and used TypeScript to better organize the project and prevent bugs.
